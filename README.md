# Electronic Trading Challenge

Jane Streetâ€™s Electronic Trading Competition, a day-long programming contest where teams competed against each other in a simulated market. Contestants wrote algorithms to trade various financial instruments such as bonds, stocks, ETFs, and ADRs, with the intention of maximizing profit. The competition was structured into five minute rounds, each simulating one day in the market. During the first competition, teams traded and built up their portfolio for ten hours. In the last hour, portfolios were reset, allowing teams to compete in a second competition with the best version of their bots.
